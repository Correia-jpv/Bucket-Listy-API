## Intro

This is a REST API with CRUD operations made with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose. It was built to serve a [bucket list web app] at [BucketListy.com].


## Demo

On the [Swagger Playground] you can test the publicly available API's endpoints and their authorization filters.


## Documentation

[Here](https://bucketlisty-api.herokuapp.com/docs/jsdoc) are documented the Express.js routers and their routes, controllers and models.


## Development
 
 These were the main requirements to fulfill when developing the API:

- MVC architecture.
- Authentication and Authorization.
- JSDoc documentation.
- Swagger UI playground.


## Built With
- [Node.js] - Back end JS runtime environment.
- [Express.js] - Back end node framework to serve the REST API.
- [MongoDB] - NoSQL database platform.
- [Mongoose] - Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB.
- [LoginRadius] - User authentication with social networks or traditional email/password.
- [Swagger UI] - Generate interactive API documentation that lets your users try out the API calls directly in the browser.
- [JSDoc] - API documentation generator for JavaScript.
- [Docstrap] - Bootstrap based template for JSDoc.


## Future Implementation

- Bucket list items categorization.
- Archives.
- Completion achievements.
